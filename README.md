# Piscine-Interview
Learn how to learn again with Big(O) notation and other cool things (Basically learn interview questions)

Since I am doing 2 Mini Piscines at once, I will focus most of the time on PHP-Piscine because it is easier. The Piscine-Interview is harder, but the majority of the grades are in rushes: which are mock interviews that I do with my fellow cadets. It's with best practice to do well in mock interviews.

A few things I noted from multiple other people who took interview piscine was there were people who only passed 1 day and 1 exam, but got both rushes corrected and still passed the interview piscine with a passing grade of over 50. I might utilize this strategy due to time constraints of doing 2 mini piscines at once.

###Day00
Did 3 problems out of 9: ex00, ex01, ex02. The rest are not finished, but the resources are there to come back to. Not enough to get any credit, so I automatically resigned.

###Day01
First problem is hard. It is a doubly, circular linked list that I am totally
unfamiliar with.
